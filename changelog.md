# Changelog

## 2.0.17 (2022-10-02)

- Correctly pass 'scope' to `authorization_code` redirects.

  2.0.16 (2022-07-22)

---

- It was not possible to generate the URL to the authorization endpoint with
  PKCE using Node, due to depending on a global `crypto` object. This is fixed
  with fallbacks all the way back to Node 14.

  2.0.15 (2022-07-07)

---

- #70: Sending the client secret is now supported with the `authorization_code`
  flow.

  2.0.14 (2022-06-23)

---

- Re-release, to publish on Github packages.

  2.0.13 (2022-06-19)

---

- Fixed some docs.

  2.0.12 (2022-06-19)

---

- First stable v2 release!
- Renamed this package from `fetch-mw-oauth2` to `@badgateway/oauth2-client`.
- #59: Scope support for `authorization_code` flow.

  2.0.11 (2022-06-17) (alpha)

---

- Re-published

  2.0.10 (2022-05-10) (alpha)

---

- Tested on Node 14, 16.
- Added polyfills for these node versions (see README).
- `generateCodeVerifier` is now async to support Node 14.

  2.0.9 (2022-04-26) (alpha)

---

- Set `Content-Type` to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

  2.0.8 (2022-04-26) (alpha)

---

- Changing the `authorization_code` signature again. It's a bit hard to come
  up with a create signature for this, especially because there's multiple
  steps in the process, and some information has to survive these steps.

  2.0.7 (2022-04-26) (alpha)

---

- Re-release (broken build).

  2.0.6 (2022-04-26) (alpha)

---

- Removed redundant parameters.
- `authorization_code` should now also work correctly without PKCE.
- Removed some redundant arguments.

  2.0.5 (2022-04-25) (alpha)

---

- PKCE support.

  2.0.4 (2022-04-20) (alpha)

---

- remove `fetchMw` and add `mw()`. `mw()` now _returns_ a middleware function.

  2.0.3 (2022-04-19) (alpha)

---

- Export `OAuth2AuthorizationCodeClient`
- Client.authorizationCode() should not have been `async`.

  2.0.2 (2022-04-19) (alpha)

---

- Fix format for `introspect()` function.

  2.0.1 (2022-04-19) (alpha)

---

- Fix introspection HTTP method name.

  2.0.0 (2022-04-19) (alpha)

---

The 2.0 version of this library is a complete rewrite. The original scope
of this library was to provide a wrapper around `fetch()` to add a `Bearer`
token and refresh this token under the hood, but it has now evolved into
a full-featured modern OAuth2 library.

The existing 'fetch wrapper' still exists, but it's not merely one of the
features this package offers. The API has changes, and while I think it
shouldn't be difficult to migrate, v2 offers no backwards compatibility
so some rewrites will be required.

New features include:

- Complete support for the `authorization_code` flow, including generating
  redirect urls and parsing query parameters after redirect.
- Support for OAuth2 endpoint discovery, using the OAuth2 Authorization
  Server Metadata document. If your server supports it, just give the
  library a URL and it will figure out the rest. [RFC8414][2].
- Support for OAuth2 token introspection ([RFC7662][3]).
- Generally a better abstraction of the OAuth2 framework.

  1.0.0 (2021-10-28)

---

- Dropped support for Node 10.
- Fixed #45: Call `onAuthError` when a refresh fails.
- Replaced `awesome-typescript-loader` with `ts-loader` for Webpack builds.
  the former appears unmaintained.
- Switched from Travis CI to Github Actions.

  0.7.7 (2021-02-22)

---

- Last version did not correctly build it's files.

  0.7.6 (2021-02-22)

---

- Better error handling when the response we got was not a standard OAuth2
  error response body + adding information for when the Basic credentials
  were wrong.
- This fixes the bug when fetch-mw-oauth2 says there's an 'undefined' error.

  0.7.5 (2020-12-03)

---

- Fixing a few broken links in package.json. Does not alter any behavior.

  0.7.3 (2020-12-01)

---

- Re-publishing package. Previous version had an old build artifact.

  0.7.2 (2020-12-01)

---

- Fixed bug that completely broke the token flow.

  0.7.1 (2020-11-30)

---

- Fix bug in auto-refresh

  0.7.0 (2020-11-30)

---

- Ensure that only 1 refresh operation will happen in parallel. If there are
  multiple things triggering the refresh, all will wait for the first one
  to finish.
- Automatically schedule a refresh operation 1 minute before the access token
  expires, if the expiry time is known.
- BC Break: If a token is known when setting up OAuth2, this now needs to be
  passed as the second argument. The old behavior still works but will emit
  a warning, and will be removed in a future release.
- 'OAuth2Token' type is now exported.

  0.6.1 (2020-11-19)

---

- #34: Refresh operation failed for the `authorization_code` flow.

  0.6.0 (2020-11-09)

---

- Added a onAuthError event, allowing users to intercept this event and
  re-authenticate.
- Simplify types a bit. More duplication in the library, but this should
  result in easier to read errors.
- Typescript 4
- Switch from tslint to eslint.
- Webpack 5

  0.5.0 (2020-04-19)

---

- Added a `fetchMw()` function that takes a `next` argument so this package
  can behave as a more regular middleware.

  0.4.2 (2019-12-09)

---

- Files were not correctly built in the last release.

  0.4.1 (2019-12-09)

---

- Error code 401 will be submitted when authentication fails. Before, we would
  just forward the error code from the OAuth2 server, but this doesn't make a
  lot of sense for a `fetch()` user, as the error might be misinterpreted as
  an error unrelated to auth.

  0.4.0 (2019-11-06)

---

- Added a `getOptions()` method, which allows a user to get all current
  tokens and store them in LocalStorage. These options can be used as-is in
  the constructor.

  0.3.5 (2019-09-05)

---

- Include typescript sourcefiles in NPM package, for IDE's.

  0.3.4 (2019-03-19)

---

- This package now throws OAuth2Error classes for server-side errors.

  0.3.3 (2019-03-18)

---

- When refreshing a token, browsers don't allow re-use of the same `Request`
  object. Now we're cloning it before use.

  0.3.2 (2019-03-13)

---

- When refreshing a token, and there's no `client_secret`, the `client_id`
  must be sent in the body.

  0.3.1 (2019-03-13)

---

- Now correctly exporting all the right symbols.

  0.3.0 (2019-03-13)

---

- Library is refactored and now uses a class.
- Support for `authorization_code` grant type.
- Exposing some more information to uses.
- Add a new `onTokenUpdate` hook for custom storage.
- It's now possible to construct a client with an existing (old) Access and/or
  refresh token.

  0.2.1 (2019-03-13)

---

- Shipping `dist/` instead of `src/`.
- Making a browser build lean by not relying on `querystring` or `Buffer`.

  0.2.0 (2019-03-12)

---

- First public version
- Support for `client_credentials`, `password` and `refresh_token`.
- Will automatically attempt to refresh tokens if it knows an access token is
  expired.
